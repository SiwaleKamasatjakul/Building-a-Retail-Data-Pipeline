# Building-a-Retail-Data-Pipeline

Source problem from Datacamp.

Project Description

In this project, I will work with retail data from a multinational retail corporation Walmart. I will retrieve data from different sources, like SQL and parquet; prepare the data using some transformation techniques, and finally load the data in an easy-to-access format.
